### Section II : Overview

**YouBike** has been one of the popular mode of transport which is replacing traditional public transportation. A large quantity of **students** and **workers** may select **YouBike** as their main transport method for daily routine. However, it is often for users cannot find any free bikes during the rush hours. Therefore, we managed to write this project to **solve relative issues**.

Firstly, we'll build a **real-time** map based on **Python Folium** for user to **interact** and **select** the specific area. Then, the website will automatically generate plots and charts by **D3.js**.
